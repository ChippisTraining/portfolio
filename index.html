                        HTML? Fine. Nice and simple. It’s just boxes inside boxes, easy peasy. CSS? Now that’s a
                        different story.
                        CSS is a wee bit of a show-off, always trying to be fancy.
                        “Look at me, I can do gradients! Ohh, I can float things!”
                        Yeah? Well, float this: Half the time, you tell CSS to do something, and it just laughs in your
                        face.

                        HTML and CSS? Pffft. Simple stuff. But JavaScript? JavaScript is like trying to have a
                        conversation with
                        a hyperactive squirrel. You tell it one thing, it does another.
                        You try to keep it contained, and suddenly, it's off in the distance,
                        throwing errors you’ve never even heard of!
                        <br>
                        You blink, and there’s a floating div. You blink again, and your entire layout’s gone.
                        One minute, everything works. The next, boom—undefined. Undefined! What does that even mean?!

                        Alright, alright! Yes, JavaScript’s a bit... unpredictable. But that’s what makes it fun!
                        It’s like a good timey-wimey paradox—you don’t fight it, you go with it.
                        Embrace the chaos, Ten! It’s just a matter of knowing how to talk to it.
                        <br>
                        Bit of a conversation, really. You say "please," it says "maybe." You threaten it, and
                        suddenly
                        it listens.
                        And if it doesn't? Well, that’s why we have console logs.

                        Oh yeah, because JavaScript totally respects politeness.
                        "Oh, please work, kind sir!" And what does it do? Throws an error anyway!
                        “Unexpected token this.” Unexpected?! Unexpected for WHO?
                        I literally just wrote it, how is it unexpected?
                        <br>
                        And don’t even get me started on asynchronous nonsense! "Oh, let’s wait for this thing."
                        "Oops, too late! It’s already broken!" Absolute nightmare.

                        JavaScript doesn't wait around, it gets on with it. You just need to know how to
